# Synthorganic
The Synthorganic Project is an innovative project aimed at transforming the functionality of prosthetic legs through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). This GitHub repository houses the source code, documentation, and resources related to the development and implementation of the adaptive prosthetics optimization system. The project is designed in TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning platform, and visualized using Blender, a 3D computer graphics software tool. The AI model is built in three progressive phases: walking on a flat surface, walking on incline/decline surfaces, and walking on varying terrains.

Key Features:

TensorFlow AI Model: The core of Synthorganic, the TensorFlow-based AI model, is developed to optimize prosthetic leg movements in real-time adaptively.

Blender Visualization: The 3D visualization of the AI model provides insights into its behavior and assists in refining its performance across diverse terrains.

Phased Development: The project is organized into distinct phases, ensuring a systematic and comprehensive approach to prosthetic leg optimization.

Integration Testing Software: Custom software tools for assessing the seamless integration of the TensorFlow AI into robotic leg hardware.

Robotic Legs Integration: The repository includes resources related to constructing a functional skeleton structure of robotic legs for integration testing.

How to Use:

**This project was developed in phases and is broken down by Sprints, but all essential files can also be located under the Blender and TensorFlow branches.**

Refer to the documentation provided within the Paperwork branch for detailed instructions on setting up and running the AI model.
You can explore the codebase for insights into the TensorFlow implementation and integration testing software.
